# Weaver Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is Weaver?

Weaver is an AI-powered platform that transforms your documents into intelligent chatbots. Upload your PDFs, DOCX files, or other documents, and Weaver creates a bot that can answer questions based on that content using advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology.

### How is Weaver different from ChatGPT?

While ChatGPT is a general-purpose AI trained on internet data, Weaver creates bots trained specifically on YOUR documents. This means:
- Answers come from your content, not the internet
- No hallucinations or made-up information
- Every answer cites the source document
- You control what knowledge the bot has
- Perfect for business-specific information

### Do I need coding experience to use Weaver?

No! Weaver is designed for non-technical users. Our dashboard provides:
- Drag-and-drop document upload
- Visual bot configuration with AI-generated prompts
- Point-and-click API key management
- Built-in test interface

Developers can use our REST API for advanced integrations.

### What document formats are supported?

Weaver supports:
- PDF (.pdf)
- Microsoft Word (.docx)
- Plain text (.txt)
- HTML (.html)

More formats coming soon (PowerPoint, Excel, Markdown).

### Is there a free tier?

Yes! The free tier includes:
- 50 queries per day
- 10 documents maximum
- 100 MB storage
- Email support
- Full API access

## Getting Started

### How do I create my first bot?

1. Sign up at weaver.com using Google OAuth
2. Upload your first document (PDF, DOCX, TXT, or HTML)
3. Wait for processing (usually 1-3 minutes)
4. Generate an API key in the API Keys tab
5. Test your bot using the built-in test panel
6. Integrate using our REST API

### How long does document processing take?

Processing time depends on document size:
- Small documents (< 10 pages): 30 seconds - 1 minute
- Medium documents (10-50 pages): 1-3 minutes
- Large documents (50-100 pages): 3-5 minutes
- Very large documents (100+ pages): 5-10 minutes

You can upload multiple documents and they'll process in parallel.

### Can I customize my bot's personality?

Absolutely! Go to the "Bot Settings" tab and describe your business:
- Business name and industry
- What your business does
- Desired tone (Professional, Friendly, Technical, Casual, Formal)
- Primary goal for the bot
- Special instructions

Weaver's AI will generate an optimal system prompt in seconds. You can edit it or regenerate it as needed.

### How do I test my bot before deploying?

Use the built-in "Test Your Bot" panel in the API Keys tab:
1. Paste an API key
2. Enter a test question
3. Choose streaming or non-streaming mode
4. Click "Run Test"
5. See results instantly

You can also test the demo bot to see how Weaver works before uploading your own documents.

## Technical Questions

### What AI models does Weaver use?

Weaver uses Google's Gemini models:
- **gemini-2.5-flash-lite**: For generating answers (fast, cost-effective)
- **gemini-embedding-001**: For creating document embeddings (768 dimensions)

We may add support for other models (OpenAI, Anthropic) in the future.

### How does RAG work?

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) works in three steps:

1. **Indexing**: Your documents are split into chunks and converted to vector embeddings
2. **Retrieval**: When a question is asked, the most relevant chunks are found using semantic search
3. **Generation**: The AI generates an answer based on the retrieved context

This ensures answers are accurate and based on your actual documents.

### What's the average response time?

Typical query latency:
- **Cached queries**: < 100ms
- **Non-cached queries**: 1.5 - 3 seconds
  - Embedding generation: 50-100ms
  - Vector search: 100-200ms
  - LLM generation: 1-2 seconds

Streaming responses start appearing within 500ms.

### How accurate are the answers?

Accuracy depends on several factors:
- **Document quality**: Clear, well-written docs produce better results
- **Question specificity**: Specific questions get better answers than vague ones
- **Document coverage**: Bot can only answer based on uploaded content

Weaver provides confidence scores:
- **High**: Multiple relevant sources found (>0.7 similarity)
- **Medium**: Some relevant sources (0.5-0.7 similarity)
- **Low**: Few relevant sources (< 0.5 similarity)

### Is my data secure?

Yes! Weaver implements multiple security layers:
- All data encrypted at rest and in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Secure multi-tenant architecture (your data is isolated)
- API key authentication with rate limiting
- SOC 2 Type II compliant infrastructure
- GDPR compliant data processing
- Regular security audits

We never train models on your data or share it with third parties.

## Usage & Limits

### What are the rate limits?

Free tier limits:
- 60 API requests per minute per key
- 50 queries per day per tenant
- 10 documents maximum
- 100 MB total storage

Pro tier limits:
- 120 API requests per minute
- 1,000 queries per day
- Unlimited documents
- 10 GB storage

### What happens when I hit the daily query limit?

When you reach 50 queries in a day:
- Further queries return a 429 error
- Limit resets at midnight UTC
- You can upgrade to Pro for higher limits

The dashboard shows your current usage: "12/50 queries used today"

### Can I upload documents in bulk?

Yes! You can upload multiple documents at once:
- Drag and drop multiple files
- Click "Select Multiple Files"
- Up to 10 files at once (free tier)
- Processing happens in parallel

### How is storage calculated?

Storage is based on the original document size:
- A 5 MB PDF counts as 5 MB
- Processed data (embeddings, chunks) doesn't count toward storage
- Deleted documents free up storage immediately

### Can I delete documents?

Yes, you can delete documents from the dashboard:
1. Go to "Upload Documents" tab
2. Click the trash icon next to any document
3. Confirm deletion
4. Document is removed immediately
5. Storage is freed up

Note: This cannot be undone. The bot will no longer have access to that document's content.

## API & Integration

### How do I get an API key?

1. Log into your Weaver dashboard
2. Go to the "API Keys" tab
3. Click "Create New API Key"
4. Give it a name (e.g., "Production Key")
5. Copy the key immediately (it won't be shown again)
6. Use it in the Authorization header: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`

### Can I have multiple API keys?

Yes! Create as many API keys as needed:
- Separate keys for development/staging/production
- Keys for different applications
- Keys with different names for tracking

Each key has the same permissions and rate limits.

### How do I revoke a compromised API key?

1. Go to the "API Keys" tab
2. Find the compromised key
3. Click the trash icon

## Troubleshooting

### Why is my document still processing?

Documents can take 1-10 minutes depending on size. If stuck for longer:
1. Check the document format is supported
2. Ensure the file isn't corrupted
3. Verify it's under the size limit (10 MB)
4. Refresh the page
5. Contact support if still stuck

### Why am I getting "low confidence" answers?

Low confidence means the bot couldn't find highly relevant information. Possible causes:
- Question is about content not in your documents
- Documents don't contain enough detail
- Question is too vague or broad
- Typos in the question

Solutions:
- Upload more comprehensive documentation
- Ask more specific questions
- Check the Analytics tab for low-confidence queries
- Refine your documents based on common questions

### Why am I getting 401 Unauthorized errors?

Common causes:
- API key is incorrect or expired
- API key was revoked
- Missing "Bearer" prefix in Authorization header
- Using session token instead of API key

Check your API key in the dashboard and ensure it's correctly formatted:
```
Authorization: Bearer sk_live_abc123...
```

### Why am I getting 429 Rate Limit errors?

You've exceeded either:
- **Minute limit**: 60 requests per minute per key (wait 1 minute)
- **Daily limit**: 50 queries per day (wait until midnight UTC or upgrade)

Check the error message for details.

### My bot isn't using my custom system prompt

Ensure you:
1. Generated a system prompt in "Bot Settings"
2. Clicked "Save & Activate Bot"
3. Waited for the save to complete
4. Refreshed your API client/cache

The prompt applies immediately to new queries.
